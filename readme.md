# Learn Anything

Explanation of project's goals is [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/ideas/learn-anything).

Current focus is on making [Tauri app](#run-tauri-app) working. Essentially an app like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Reference [file structure](#file-structure) to make sense of how code is laid out in the repo.

Read [setup](#setup) to get started with development.

Sharing [current tasks in readme](#tasks) until MVP is released.

Ask questions on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bxtD8x6aNF) if interested in developing the project or you get issues with setup.

## File structure

- [api](api) - server related actions
  - [db](api/db) - EdgeDB used as main server database
    - [dbschema](api/db/dbschema)
      - [default.esdl](api/db/dbschema/default.esdl) - [EdgeDB schema](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/intro/schema) definining all the models and relations

- [lib](lib) - shared utility functions
- [test](test) - test cases (useful for itereating quickly)
- [website](website) - learn-anything.xyz website code
  - [components](website/components) - solid components
  - [routes](app/packages/website/routes) - routes defined using file system

## Setup

This project is a monorepo setup using [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

Everything is driven using `pnpm ..` commands. First run:

```
pnpm i
pnpm dev-setup
```

`pnpm dev-setup` will `git clone` [seed repo](https://github.com/learn-anything/seed). It's needed for dev setup + [test suite](#test) to work.

## Run Tauri app

> to complete

Moving code from [Electron version](https://github.com/learn-anything/electron-version).

### Useful DevTools panel

In the app you get after running `pnpm app:dev`, you will see DevTools panel in bottom right corner. It contains a list of useful actions you can run to aid you.

One of the actions is `Seed TinyBase`. This will seed your local TinyBase store/sqlite with [one of the wikis](https://github.com/learn-anything/seed/tree/main/wiki/nikita) in seed folder.

Read [app/packages/preload/src/index.ts](app/packages/preload/src/index.ts) file for details. `syncWikiFromSeed` is the function.

## Test

```
pnpm test
```

Will run tests found in [test](test).

[test/wiki.test.ts](test/wiki.test.ts) file tests markdown file parsing.

Running code via tests is very effective. You can open terminal on your right and edit code on the left and on each `.ts` file save it will rerun the test and check if behavior you are testing is correct. Reading through the test suite is great way to understand the backend part of the app.

<!-- You can point the tests at your own wiki/notes folder too. Put the folder with files into seed/test folder you get from running `pnpm dev-setup` -->

## Setup EdgeDB

> First need to make Electron + TinyBase + Solid sync work smoothly. Check ## Tasks

Assumes you installed [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/) (run `curl ..` command).

```
pnpm db:init
```

Follow instructions, name EdgeDB instance `learn-anything`.

Run `edgedb ui`. This will open EdgeDB graphical interface where you can run queries or explore the schema.

Run below command to apply the schema defined in [default.esdl](db/dbschema/default.esdl) on your local DB:

```
pnpm db:watch
```

Then, generate [EdgeDB TS](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js) bindings with:

```
pnpm db:ts-generate
```

<!-- ## Seed DB with content -->

<!-- The goal is to seed EdgeDB with [this content](https://github.com/learn-anything/seed/tree/main/wiki/nikita). Can be seen online [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev).

However you can try seed it with a wiki / folder of markdown of yourself.

Just add a folder in `seed/wiki` like `seed/wiki/my-wiki` and put some .md files inside. -->

<!-- ## Run Sync DB code

The goal of this command:

```
pnpm db:sync
```

Is to sync your local EdgeDB instance with the contents of the `seed` folder you just cloned.

For this, you need to create a file here:`api/db/sync/.env`. With content like this:

```
SEED_FOLDER_NAME=nikita
USERNAME=nikita
```

You can swap the names to your own. The `SEED_FOLDER_NAME` is the folder that is found in `seed/wiki`.

Read [api/db/sync/sync.ts](api/db/sync/sync.ts) and [api/db/sync/wiki.ts](api/db/sync/wiki.ts) for details how sync works. -->

## Run server

> First need to make Electron + TinyBase + Solid sync work smoothly. Check ## Tasks

Before running server, create file at `api/server/.env` with this content:

```
EDGEDB_INSTANCE=learn-anything
EDGEDB_SECRET_KEY=edbt_ey
```

`EDGEDB_SECRET_KEY` can be gotten by running `pnpm db:ui` which will open the EdgeDB UI.

In terminal after running above command you will see url like `http://localhost:10700/ui?authToken=edbt_ey`. `EDGEDB_SECRET_KEY` is the authToken content.

Then run:

```
pnpm api
```

In future [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com/) will be used for all API requests. There is blocker there that you can't do both public and private resolvers.

```
pnpm api:grafbase
```

Will start Grafbase locally and give you GraphQL access.

## Run web

> First need to make Electron + TinyBase + Solid sync work smoothly. Check ## Tasks

<!-- TODO: automate creating of `.env` file with default content as part of `pnpm setup` command -->
<!-- TODO: do same for API .env too -->

Create `.env` file inside [website](app/packages/website) with this content:

```
VITE_HANKO_API=https://e879ccc9-285e-49d3-b37e-b569f0db4035.hanko.io
API_OF_GRAFBASE=http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```

[Hanko](https://www.hanko.io/) is used as auth provider. You can swap Hanko API variable content with one from a project you create yourself.

Run:

```
pnpm web:dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Contribute

The tasks to do are outlined below.

If you are interested in helping out, please join [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bxtD8x6aNF) and let's make it happen. âœ¨

The project is incredibly ambitious once it works.

## Tasks

> sorted by priority

- make app work with Tauri
  - this app used electron before but it had issues when trying to deploy it, code for it [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/electron-version)
- add sqlite persistence
  - what tinybase did in electron version
- move markdown parser from ts to rust
  - use [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs)
- hardlink `lib` folder from `app` and `website` so `lib` functions can actually be used when deploying
- load nikita's wiki into tinybase/sqlite and run queries, check in app, all data is there correctly
  - `pnpm ts-run` will run [run.ts](run.ts) file that has code to load things into tinybase from seed/wiki/nikita
- make [test/wiki.test.ts](test/wiki.test.ts) test pass (partly done, trying to load nikita's wiki and see what breaks)
  - add tests for files that break into test suite with proper `expect` checks
- electron app close to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)/[Reflect](https://reflect.app/) in UX
  - be able to edit markdown files, show sidebar of files/folders on the left
  - sync up with file system, using [watcher package](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/watcher) most likely
- everything nicely persisted to tinybase with solid.js store syncing working well
  - test well
- setup proper code sharing between monorepo packages
  - there is `lib` and `components` folders at root
    - should be usable across all the mono repo
  - the way packages are imported should be thought out well
    - which packages get installed at root? which go to specific package?
- would be nice if app/packages did not exist potentially
  - just don't think app/packages is nice structure, maybe move everything into app/
  - afraid to modify it as it came from template and moving things will break
- in dev tools panel when you click on `Seed TinyBase (default)`, it seeds with default files
  - also add `Seed TinyBase (custom)`, then provide an option of folders to choose what to seed so users can provide custom folders to seed quickly
- is there need for app/packages/electron-web/package.json?
  - or app/package.json is enough
  - it's all the same bundle I would think
- VSCode does not automatically suggest imports from [lib](lib) folder (super annoying)
  - also imports use relative imports like `../../lib`. should be `~/lib/` instead
  - use pnpm for this? tsconfig?
  - if you do global import from [test](test), it will actually do non relative imports
    - however imports from [app](app) to say [lib](lib) won't work, maybe due to tsconfig in app folder

## Better DX

- Setup [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) to get one command dev env install. Currently we ask to install EdgeDB manually for example.
- Can potentially [use only one codebase for both web code and electron app renderer code](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/discussions/1011), using [vite-plugin-ssr](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/).
  - Electron expects `index.html` file as entry but [Solid Start](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start) does not provide a `index.html` file. At least I don't know how to make that work so for now its split up. The app is quite different to the website in features so it's even for the best.

## Notes

> to be moved to docs/ and deployed with vitepress later

- Text editor once used [Solid CodeMirror](https://github.com/riccardoperra/solid-codemirror). Similar to [CodeImage project](https://github.com/riccardoperra/codeimage). But there were issues in making it work nicely. So now [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) is used.
- [Inlang](https://github.com/inlang/inlang), [CodeImage](https://github.com/riccardoperra/codeimage), [Actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) have great code to take inspiration from.
  - [Inlang's tech stack](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/blob/main/rfcs/tech-stack/RFC.md) specifically is very great.
